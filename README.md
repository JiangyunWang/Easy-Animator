# Easy Animator
A picture is worth a thousand words, and moving pictures are worth many more.

Pictures and moving pictures (animations) can be used to succinctly and effectively illustrate many things. For example, a stationary histogram visually depicts the distribution of some data points. A histogram with moving bar heights visually depicts music (e.g. a music equalizer). Animating graphs can be used to show useful trends in data much more effectively than presenting the same reasoning using raw numbers and text (see here for a visualization of the trend of life expectancy with GDP over time using only circles). A fireworks display is simply a bunch of points moving in certain ways. The Towers of Hanoi problem can be illustrated more effectively as an animation solving it, rather than a description of steps of an algorithm. Many algorithms can be similarly visualized in a way that illustrates how they work more succinctly than descriptions or code. 

One of the more frustrating experiences is knowing what to visualize, having a plan for how to visualize it using simple shapes and animations, but not being able to quickly create such an animation. Creating animations takes time, and one must learn the necessary tools that are often difficult to master (e.g., using Flash, or creating Web animations using HTML5 and Javascript, etc.). Such tools are often also special-purpose. For example, the statistical package R comes with charting capabilities, but code must be written in R and data must be formatted accordingly. Similarly creating animations is not difficult in Powerpoint, but the tool is embedded in Powerpoint and one cannot use it to create other kinds of animation.

Our team built an application that helps to create simple but effective 2D animations from shapes (such as the above examples). One of our main goals will be to create a separation between how an algorithm or phenomenon is described and how it is drawn on the screen. This separation will allow us to create an application that will draw an animation according to how it is described in text, without being tied to how the description was produced.

In other words, our application will show animations generated manually or using any other program, unrelated to our application.

***Notice***
This project' code can't be public published. But I uploaded somes svg files which was operated by our code and the jar.
Meanwhile, I screeshotted the our animator's GUI interface.
If you need watch code please email me, I will send it privately.
